BattleBit Offset Dumper
==========================

Dump offsets with `cargo run --release -- "GameAssembly.dll" ini > stdout.ini`. The script will analyze the executable and extract its offsets. Use these offsets to update your cheat. You can get human readable output without offsets with `cargo run --release -- "GameAssembly.dll" human > stdout.md`.
